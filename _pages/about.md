I'm a Physics undergrad at the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore. My interests lie in theoretical Condendes Matter Physics, and the application of such methods in related fields like Biophysics and High Energy Physics. Previously, I've worked at TIFR to understand fluctuations in disordered superconductors. Some of the coursework I've taken include Quantum Statistical Field Theory, Lie Algebras and Representations (Advanced Meth Methods in Physics), Condensed Matter Physics 1 and Quantum Computing & Measurement.

Additionally, I also have an interest in exploring Mathematics, both with regards to applications in my field and also for fun. My interests were supported and enhanced at the Ross Math program at the Ohio State University in 2018. Here, we were encouraged to explore the field of number thoery through exploratory problem sets, and building up the theorems and insight through this exploration. The collaborative nature of the program nesseciated that many of us work together which resulted in many friends.

I had represented India at the International Olympiad in Astronomy and Astrophysics (IOAA) in 2018 at Beijing, China. It was a series of coincidences that led to this happening, and ended up in creating an interest in ametuer astronomy in myself. This is a hobby I maintain to this day (and night, when the clouds are clear). I've also facilitated the team selection camp in 2019, where I assisted in the creation of the tests, grading and the guiding of students through this vast field.
